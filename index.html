                <p class="text-muted text-left">Delhi Public School, Nalconagar, Angul, was founded in the year 1984 sponsored by National Aluminium Company and boasts of being only the third satellite school to be set up under the aegis of Delhi Public School Society.  Situated 130 Kms away from Bhubaneswar in a serene and calm environment, the school lies sprawling in 30 acres of greenery with a multi purpose hall, auditorium, well stocked library, well equipped laboratories and play fields.  A dedicated and efficient team of teachers work relentlessly to nurture and encourage the inherent talents of the students especially stressing on overall development of the child.  Co curricular and extra curricular activities, sports and games, art, music and dance together with academics hone the skills of the students and prepare them to face the ever increasing challenges of a globalized world.  In keeping with the motto of ‘Service before Self ’, students are encouraged to play active role in local orphanages and in assisting the less fortunate ones. The school is affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education with Science and Commerce stream and has just completed its 25th year and with student strength of more than 2000. It is no wonder that it attracts innumerable students from the vicinity and holds a place of an icon in the area.</p>

                        <p>Saw it today with my kids and they loved it.You should have a minimal previous understanding of the movies or you’ll miss 40% of the fun.At minimum:Infinity WarCivil WarBlack PantherAge ofAnt Man and the WaspProblem is that the whole movie is homage to all movies. Yet you will enjoy it a lot.There is at the beginning of the movie a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. But most is comic book style figand battles.Must go to bathroom just before the movie because ut does last 3 hours all worthwhile.</p>

                            <p>Bottom Line: The film will bring back the magic for your t(w)een, who was a fan of the original. But, it could be too intense for preschoolers. There are some spoilers below in the full review. Full Review: While it had some great songs, and I thought better instrumental music, I still like the music from the original better. The reprise of "Into the Unknown" at the end of the movie is sung by Panic! At the Disco - clearly meant to appeal to the original Frozen fans, who are now tweens and teens.</p>

                            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">In an effort to be more environmentally responsible, LEGO have said they aim to stop manufacturing bricks made of plastic resin and are considering other options, which could include hemp. According to Telegraph World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the effective “clicking” together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured block.</p>

                            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The perceived scale of the Amazon blazes received global attention this summer. However, international concerns raised at the time were countered by the Brazilian Government, which claimed the fire situation in August was 'normal' and 'below the historical average'.An international team of scientists writing in the journal Global Change Biology say the number of active fires in August was actually three times higher than in 2018 and the highest number since 2010.</p>
